      <p>Goals Achieved: <br>
          1. Basic data harvesting and storage with automated computer programs,<br>
          2. Data “munging” or cleaning to process data,<br>
          3. Analyzing data with existing methods such as descriptive statistics and visualizations,<br>
          4. Developing new, problem-specific measures to explore trends and features in data, and<br>
          5. Communicating data-driven results.<br>
          Dataset: In the United States, State laws require the reporting of fetal deaths, and Federal law mandates national collection and publication of fetal death data. 
          Fetal death data is published annually by the National Center for Health Statistics, in reports and as individual-record data files. 
          I analyzed this data to find the cause of fetal death by selected characteristics such as mother’s age, mother’s origin, race, mother’s residence status, fetal sex, period of gestation, birth-weight, mother’s height and risk factors.
